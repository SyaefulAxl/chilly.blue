This is Spec.”</p>\n<p>I said something stupid to the degree of “Uhh, this is a trainee”. Then I walked up the 3 flights up stairs to Spectator’s Super Bowl LI watch party. Walking into the main congregation space (I have no clue what it is called… projector room?) I saw a table of laptopping Speccies (Spectator people?) working on all sorts of things while waiting for the Super Bowl stream (probably found off Reddit) to come up. Recognizing a fellow trainee, I promptly took the space to his right on the couch. In truth, I didn’t plan on staying long. My clothes were in the dryer and I thought I’d stop by to show some appreciation for being invited. It was kind of awkward, being a newbie surrounded by a roomful of people hard at work. It was also kind of strange considering how few trainees actually showed up (boy am I a complainer). However, I was already there. As such, I sat around and talked to people who I hoped would become a big part of my Columbia life.</p>\n<h2>Blood, sweat, and time</h2>\n<p>In some places, blood and sweat seem to be the emphasis. Some extracurriculars ask you to push your limits in regards to physical and mental exertion. As an actor last semester, I suppose I was expected to find some method to learn my lines, learn the dance, become the character. However, something about Spectator seems to suggest blood and sweat are to be expected. I recall the publisher’s little summary of his talk on expectations. In short, mediocrity would not be accepted. To me, thats a firm statement blood and sweat are the base line. What’s being poured out in that building, even more worrisome than the sweat and blood, is the gross excess of time.</p>\n<p>Relevant image which I’m not too sure I’m allowed to share.</p>\n<p>{% include partials/imagePartial.html src=“/media/specimage.png” width=“1468” height=“556” %}</p>\n<h2>How I got here</h2>\n<p>Just about a week ago, I had nothing to do with Spec(tator).</p>\n<p>The first application, submitted in the early hours of Saturday morning, was all sorts of rough. I was pretty sure I wrote junk but my schedule was looking pretty bad and I couldn’t afford to spend anything more than a quarter of an hour on that nightmare. I was mostly frightened by my 150 word responses to the 500 word paragraphs they expected… whoops.</p>\n<p>The open house, which I went to a day after, was pretty cool. There was a nice talk on mobile apps, web apps, the front end, the back end, the works. What I remembered best was asking the head of web apps a stupid question. No regrets?</p>\n<p>After that open house, two days later, I got a notification that I got accepted to the first round of interviews. I set up a 15 minute slot two days later and <em>I forgot about it</em>.</p>\n<p>Thank goodness I had a phone alarm set, or I would have completely slept through it.</p>\n<p>I went to my interview completely and utterly sleep deprived. I drank a venti americano before stepping foot on the Spec’s block. I drank another coffee afterwards to calm my nerves.</p>\n<p>The second interview was such an ordeal, I won’t speak of it. We had obscenely difficult questions, a group interview, and a written test…</p>\n<p>But on the bright side, I’m now part of SpecTech, the part of the Spectator that makes cool tech stuff related to the Spectator.</p>\n<p>Phew. I feel like I breezed over that, but I really didn’t plan on going too in depth on the application process. However, I hope someday, it will serve as some assurance to some future Spec applicant.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Spectated",date:"February 06, 2017"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/posts/2017-02-06-spectated/2017-02-06-spectated/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/posts/2017-02-05-candle/2017-02-05-candle/"},frontmatter:{title:"Candle"}},next:{fields:{slug:"/posts/2017-02-07-health/2017-02-07-health/"},frontmatter:{title:"Health"}}}}}});
