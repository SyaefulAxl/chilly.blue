As for measurements, the wallet comes down to 9.5 x 7 cm, which is pretty damn small. However, the wallet carries all the cards I have along with the rewards cards I get from coffee shops and other places. However, some cards, ones wider than a credit card, don’t fit in this wallet. As for other “fitting issues”, one may feel that the cash sticks out of the top. This is merely a matter of breaking in the wallet. One thing I don’t like about this wallet is how soft and flimsy it is. In a way, that is to be expected. After all, it’s made from 2-3 oz leather. Just don’t go cramming two dozen bills or a dozen credit cards… and you should be fine.</p>\n<p>Let me know if you try this out!
