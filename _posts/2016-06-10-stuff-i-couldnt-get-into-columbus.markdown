Two Two Eight Two Four Five.


Young man,  
There's an ATM across the street.  
Use it - get some cash,  
But first,  
Do me  
A favor and,  
Get off the line.


I'll pay in cash.  
Thanks for the help, man.  
I pay you back.  
This guy.  
This guy though.  
I don't understand.  
What's with this guy though.


Are you going?  
No no id rather stay  
At home.


The fifty something  
Year old lady.  
From the projects  
With the  
And the   
And the dog named  
And the pregnant  
And the ex on  
And the love of dogs  
And full of affection  
For us even though we don't know her  
For me even though I stole  
Her story because I loved her


Yawns rumble  
In the ears rumble  
Dance floor rumble  
Learn to dance rumble  
Skin sweat water rumble  
King and a queen rumble  
A dozen jacks and their phones  
Rumble  
Jackshit


I like what you did  
With your eyes  
But I didn't tell you  
And I kind of am  
Losing course of where  
I'm heading


Trinity tiger  
It's natural  
We all are trinity Tigers  
We all tiger around  
Two hundred of us tigers  
Tigering tigers tiger other tigers  
Tigers tiger other tigers tiger  
Tigering many tigers  
Expecting tigers to tiger  
Tiger tiger tiger tiger tiger tiger tiger?  
No tiger.


Did you not get the hint?  
The hint?  
The  
Hint?  
Well do I  
Have new for  
You my dear  
Sir friend Madame  
Mademoiselle  
I like that one there


You are not the type  
Right?  
I will kill you if you don't  
But I won't  
Because I  
Don't care about you  
Enough to have the slightest  
Inclination to help you.


Knees weak  
Arms are in the air  
Got you with my eyes  
For the briefest moment  
And away we go  
And away I go  
And away I try to find a way  
To escape to another day  
Another day down the road  
Perhaps even a test day  
It's late and time  
To sleep


Dragons breath  
Bursting out from the side  
Alluring  
Overwhelming  
Spiteful jealous self harming  
Two sides of a coin  
A coin buried in shit


Dear maxi kaxi  
Do you see what's going on  
Do you see  
How stupid I am  
Let the fellow dream  
Im no fellow  
Who knows what I am  
I only know I'm not


Four One Six Nine Five Nine.


Butterflies and lullabies pretending to fly free,  
Flying thoughts and flowing dreams,  
Foie gras of human flesh,  
The best liars are the most honest,  
Chewing gum and deodorant,  
Lose.  
Three free nowhere to be,  
Damnation in a notebook?  
Breathe in and then,  
Breathe out with your nostrils,  
Flaring.  
I think Sylvia Plath likes vodka.  
Find me if you want me to fill in the details.  
...Except me and people who still possess a sense of taste.  
Lots and lots of shitty...  
He takes the easy way out.  
Both of us take the easy way out.  
Theres no... here.  
Only flesh.  
And sometimes that is alright.  
And sometimes that is alright.  
Acid slosh ceramic.  
Dripping into whirling down.  
I hope I'm not the root...  
...Somewhere in the ballpark of six or seven.  
Playing life...  
I'm glad to be thought of as a friend,  
When I'm hundreds of miles below,  
Looking upwards at you with awe.  
You make it out as if,  
I'm just as special as you are.


Five Three Four Three Nine.


And listening to all the people around things get clearer,  
Sometimes looking inwards does nothing to fix the problem.  
But still, the key to the outside may be locked up inside.  
Nothing much to say except that things just keep on going,
