It's been a long time since I've last written anything down here. The last time I wrote something, it was still nice and sunny outside. I was still in my internship at DIDiT and was still working weekends at the Bubble Tea Shop on 105th st. (Shiny Tea). I was still a high school student in the sense that college hadn't started yet so nobody was calling me a freshman, and by freshman I mean first year, at that point. My left eye saw things with more acuity back then. My teeth were probably whiter back then. I lived with my parents and didn't have to worry about laundry or food or dishes too much.

The bed I slept in every night was comfortable and welcoming. High school friends were physically and socially closer. Pokemon Go did not deport it's popularity to Asia yet. I thought I was real hot stuff at computer science (I'm not).

Since then, I've had my first taste of university life. It's really different. Lot more freedom and yet not enough time to really get a feel for it. As a intended Computer Science major, I took 1007, Professor Kender's Honors Intro. to Java course. Really. Hard. But it felt like it was worth it. I learned alot and got a feel for the "bleeding-in-a-Google-cubicle" (in the words of Professor Kender) life.

I've also pretty surprisingly enjoyed my core classes. Lit Hum and Fro Sci are nice.

Alright, I should call it a night. It's 4 AM. To close things up, here's a nice clip from a game I just played while procrastinating.
