One of the demos involves making a <a href="http://socket.io/get-started/chat/">chat</a>, which happens to be one of the checkpoints on a highschool app I’m still working on… </p>\n<p>Well, here is a slightly fleshed out version of the above demo. It includes identification through random numbers, private messaging, and a few other surprises that I’m sure you could figure out.</p>\n<p>The chat itself is currently hosted for free, albeit with credit card identification, through Microsoft Azure. The process was pretty painless and the service seems great thus far.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> So I ended up switching to OpenShift, which is where the chat is currently hosted. I made this decision because Microsoft Azure’s free trial lasts for a year and the pricing calculator is confusing. On the flipside, OpenShift lasts for the foreseeable future and doesn’t have my credit card.</p>\n<p><a href="https://chat.chilly.blue">https://chat.chilly.blue</a></p>',frontmatter:{title:"A Fleshed Out Socket.io Demo",date:"June 16, 2016"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/posts/2016-06-16-socketio-chat/2016-06-16-socketio-chat/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/posts/2016-06-10-stuff-i-couldnt-get-into-columbus/2016-06-10-stuff-i-couldnt-get-into-columbus/"},frontmatter:{title:"A Work in Progress"}},next:{fields:{slug:"/posts/2016-07-09-leather-bifold/2016-07-09-leather-bifold/"},frontmatter:{title:"Leather Bifold"}}}}}});
