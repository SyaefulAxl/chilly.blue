Woke up today all sore  
tried to ignore it but I could not  
my throat hurt a lot so I took  
some medicine.  
  
It's been a while since I've sat down to write  
while there's still light and the sun still shines bright  
I do all my work at night and its weird not writing  
when its darker and colder outside.  
  
Daily posts I say  
but is it okay if I break that trend  
forget to send my thoughts for the day  
and still say I'm active... somewhat?  
  
I wonder why there are people who pray  
and send away their troubles to their god  
is it odd to make noises when eating food  
or does it satisfy some higher power.  
  
Benadryl has got me all tired.  
I feel I'm wired all wrong.  
I want to bring people along with me on my journey.  
I hope I end up somewhere.  
  
Falling asleep after sleeping  
reaping the benefits of a solid education  
compensation for the trauma of a sleeping student  
one that I hope won't be me.  
  
Looking for praise  
Days are a haze of classes and work.  
I lurk around in a state only semi awake.  
Good grief my throat.  
  
Snow on the sidewalks outside,  
Wide stretches of land salted,  
refreezing halted but at what cost.  
Ice breaks soles but salt eats soles.  
  
Medicine is kicking in  
Can't win against something I am  
Can only cram work off for sick days  
I learned nothing.  
  
Endless rolling stomach rumble,  
Am I humble or am I a nervous wreck.  
I'll check myself  
to make sure everything is alright.  
  
Sometimes I struggle to get the words out.  
I doubt whether I convey what I'm thinking.  
When I'm sinking I do a better job.  
Reclaiming that feeling of being lost.
